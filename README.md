# minimal-react-boilerplate

**Purpose**

* save time from having to reconstruct webpack config/setup for each project using react

**Credits**

* the base setup was constructed from this tutorial by Robin Wieruch: https://www.robinwieruch.de/minimal-react-webpack-babel-setup/

   * then enhanced with my own dev preferences
